p = 0; k=1;
while k< n:
    p = p+k
    k = k+1

for the program fragmant above, which of the following is loop invariant 1r true at the begining of each execution of the loop and at the completion of the loop?
    

    Pick one 

a) p = sum(m, m= 0..k-1)
b) p = sum(m, m=0..k)
c) p = (k-1)^2
d) p = n*(n-1)/2
e) p = sum(m, m=0..n-1)
